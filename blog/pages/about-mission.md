## 🌌 The Stacked Infraverse

The Stacked Infraverse is a digital ecosystem where content, automation, and infrastructure converge. It’s the "operating system" behind everything that I'm working on—including this publication.

You can think of Stacked Infraverse as the place where everything I'm doing in the physical world come together with everything I'm doing in the digital world. It's the place where actions, workflows, projects, and systems meet story.

It's platform is a public chronicle of one engineer rebuilding everything—from the inside out: Physical to Digital, Home Lab to Cloud, Career to Content, Infrastructure to Identity. It’s part technical showcase and part creative outlet to share the fun I'm having in the sandbox of my playground.

Within the Infraverse, you’ll find:

-   A small, but growing collection of GitHub repos with real, working configurations of various homelab projects
-   Public and private infrastructure setups
-   Software development projects
-   Technical documentation and editorial content
-   Homelab builds that evolve alongside cloud-native architecture
-   Visual systems, diagrams, and AI-assisted workflows
-   Personal and professional infrastructure rebuilt in public

The intention is to have everything built and documented in public GitHub repos for others to see, fork, clone and build upon.

The intention is to have everything open source, built with intention.

## 📖 The Rebuild (This Publication)

_The Rebuild_ is the official independent publication of the Stacked Infraverse.

The Stacked Infraverse is the point in time and space. The Rebuild is where we tell the story.

Here, you’ll find:

-   Blog posts
-   Project breakdowns
-   Experiments
-   Wins, failures, and lessons learned
-   Systems, workflows, careers, and identity—rebuilt from the local command line to the cloud, from personal tools to professional platforms

It's not marketing. It’s not a résumé. It’s proof of work, built with transparency and shared with intent.

You won’t just see the outcomes. You’ll see the thinking, the wiring, the why, as well as the how to.

Whether you’re deep into Software Development, DevOps, Home Lab, Content Creation—or just curious about building infrastructure that scales your life and career—we cover it all here in The Rebuild.

## 🔎 Why Does This Exist?

Because résumés don’t tell the whole story. Portfolios should be lived, not just linked. Building in public is the most honest way to grow.

I created Stacked Infraverse and The Rebuild to:

-   Show what’s possible when one combines an idea with real systems, real automation, and real intent
-   Attract opportunities by publishing value instead of chasing algorithms
-   Share everything I know (and learn) to help others do the same

Whether you’re rebuilding your own stack—or just figuring out where to start—you’re welcome here.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

Technically, this is a blog. But I tend to think of it as a rebuild log where I am documenting every aspect of this home lab rebuild project, which is an amalgamation of several smaller projects.

Expect to see:

-   💡 End-to-end homelab architectures
-   ☁️ Cloud-native deployments (AWS, GCP, Azure)
-   ⚙️ Automation with GitHub Actions, containers, and shell magic
-   👨🏻💻 The trials and tribulations of software engineering and development
-   🧠 Agentic AI workflows for content and operations
-   📚 Content systems that turn builds into blogs, podcasts, and videos

Everything is open. Everything is documented. Everything is built with purpose.

## 🔍 Transparency & Proof of Work

Stacked Infraverse isn’t about showing off—it’s about showing up.

This project is built in public:

-   Configurations, How To's and more will all be published to GitHub
-   Infrastructure diagrams, tool choices, and mistakes are documented in GitHub as well
-   Every shortcut, lesson, and decision gets explained

You won’t just see the polished result. You’ll see the path that got us to the outcome - successful or not.

✅ The goal is full-stack transparency:  
From homelab configs to GitHub workflows, from content pipelines to production setups—**everything is open**.

If this content helps even one other person rebuild their systems, their confidence, or their future... it’s worth sharing.

___

## 🔥 The Mission: Rebuild With Purpose

This entire project is guided by one idea:

> **Build systems that speak louder than résumés.**

Technology is often viewed as a black box of sorts. You put something in and you get something back.

It's much deeper than that. Technology inclusive, impactful, powerful, and creative. Like music, art, literature... it has the power and potential to change lives.

Stacked Infraverse exists to prove that:

-   Tech can be for anyone willing to build and learn
-   Diversity and inclusion belong in every stack
-   Purpose matters more than polish

Whether you're a curious builder, a tired sysadmin, a future DevOps leader, or someone just trying to figure it all out—this is your space.
