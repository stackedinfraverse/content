# stacked-infraverse: Content

## Overview
This repository houses documentation, diagrams, notes, architectural design, and similar
editorial content for the stacked-infraverse homelab project. From architectural planning
and diagrams to long-form writing, podcast and video notes/scripts, and publishing
workflows will all be here. If it shows up on the Internet somewhere like my blog, social
media, podcast, youtube or newsletter, etc. , its likely to be in this repo.

This is the **brain of the project**, designed to support both infrastructure clarity and
public-facing storytelling.


## Key Features
- 📖 Markdown-first documentation and architecture notes
- 🧠 Planning docs, decision logs, and reference materials
- 🖼️  Diagrams (Mermaid, screenshots, architecture flows)
- 🎙️  Long-form media content: blog posts, podcast scripts, newsletters
- ⚙️  Supports CI/CD for automated publishing pipelines


## Folder Structure (expected - to grow over time)

`/blog/` # Markdown posts with frontmatter
`/diagrams/` # Mermaid or image-based visual architecture
`/docs/` # High-level design docs and specs
`/drafts/` # Unpublished or in-progress content
`/images/` # Embedded images and screenshots
`/notes/` # Scratch notes, ideas, lessons learned
`/podcast/` # Scripts, episode notes, transcripts, and media links
`/video/` #/docs/ # High-level design docs and specs


## Goals
- Centralize all homelab documentation and creative content 
- Enable AI-assisted workflows and automation for publishing
- Provide context, clarity, and visibility into the homelab stack
- Migrate to a public site (e.g., Ghost, Hugo, Substack)


## Future Plans
- [ ] Add complete architectural diagrams for infra/services/content
- [ ] Document all deployed Docker/Kubernetes stacks and services roles
- [ ] Integrate changelog or decision logs per component
- [ ] Track upgrade paths for local services
- [ ] Automate publishing pipeline for blog/newsletter output
- [ ] Publish CI/CD workflows for infra/services/content pipelines
